    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A display label for the CodeListGroup. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Universe/index`
Cardinality

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the universe statement describing the persons or other objects to which the contents of this CodeList group pertain.

ConceptReference

    :doc:`/composite-types/InternationalCodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

If subjects are listed for this group, it is strongly recommended that the subjects listed also be found in the TopicalCoverage element for the parent packaging element when this group is included directly or by reference in a module containing a coverage element. Use of subject at the group level allows for associating objects as a type of subject based group or to identify subject characteristics of a reusable group of objects.

Keyword

    :doc:`/composite-types/InternationalCodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

If keywords are listed for this group, it is strongly recommended that the keywords listed also be found in the TopicalCoverage element for the parent packaging element when this group is included directly or by reference in a module containing a coverage element. Use of keyword at the group level allows for associating objects as a type of keyword based group or to identify keyword characteristics of a reusable group of objects.

CodeListReference

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/CodeList/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to constituent CodeList.

    :doc:`/item-types/CodeListGroup/index`
Cardinality
    0..1
