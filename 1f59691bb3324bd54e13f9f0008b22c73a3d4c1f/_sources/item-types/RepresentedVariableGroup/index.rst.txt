RepresentedVariableGroup
------------------------

Contains a group of RepresentedVariables, which may describe an ordered or hierarchical relationship structure. RepresentedVariables may be grouped for a wide range of reasons including conceptual or universe grouping, usage, subject or keyword relationships, or other grouping reason that will assist in the management of a group of RepresentedVariables. Specifies the purpose of the group, a name, label, and description of the group, its relationship to a specific universe or concept, and lists the members of the group.

TypeOfRepresentedVariableGroup
******************************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:logicalproduct:3_3

A generic element for specifying a reason for a RepresentedVariableGroup. Note that this element can contain either a term from a controlled vocabulary list or a textual description.

RepresentedVariableGroupName
****************************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:logicalproduct:3_3

A name for the RepresentedVariableGroup. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A display label for the RepresentedVariableGroup. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A description of the content and purpose of the RepresentedVariableGroup. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

UniverseReference
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Universe/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the universe statement describing the persons or other objects to which the contents of this group pertain. TypeOfObject should be set to Universe.

ConceptReference
****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Concept/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the concept expressed by the objects in this group. TypeOfObject should be set to Concept.

Subject
*******

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/InternationalCodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

If subjects are listed for this group, it is strongly recommended that the subjects listed also be found in the TopicalCoverage element for the parent packaging element when this group is included directly or by reference in a module containing a coverage element. Use of subject at the group level allows for associating objects as a type of subject based group or to identify subject characteristics of a reusable group of objects.

Keyword
*******

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/InternationalCodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

If keywords are listed for this group, it is strongly recommended that the keywords listed also be found in the TopicalCoverage element for the parent packaging element when this group is included directly or by reference in a module containing a coverage element. Use of keyword at the group level allows for associating objects as a type of keyword based group or to identify keyword characteristics of a reusable group of objects.

    :doc:`/item-types/RepresentedVariable/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to constituent RepresentedVariable (from the substitution group). TypeOfObject should be set to RepresentedVariable.

RepresentedVariableGroupReference
*********************************
