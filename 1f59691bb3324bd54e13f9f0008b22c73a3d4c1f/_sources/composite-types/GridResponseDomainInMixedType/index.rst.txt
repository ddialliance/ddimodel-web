GridResponseDomainInMixedType
-----------------------------

Designates the response domain and the cells using the specified response domain within a QuestionGrid. Supports the use of ResponseAttachmentLocation and attachmentBase for defining specific relationships between response domains in a StructuredMixedGridResponseDomain. Functions similar to a ResponseDomainInMixed within a QuestionItem.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

ResponseDomain
**************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/RepresentationType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

This is a substitution head and can be replaced by any valid member of the substitution group for ResponseDomain.

ResponseDomainReference
***********************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/ManagedRepresentation/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

The inclusion of a response domain by reference (must be supported by a managed representation). An abstract element. May be substituted by any valid object of substitution type ResponseDomainReference.

ResponseAttachmentLocation
**************************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/AttachmentLocationType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

Allows attachment of a secondary response domain to a specific item within another response domain used in the question grid. For example, attach a TextDomain to the value "Other" using the TextDomain label (Please specify) as a label for the TextDomain.

GridAttachment
**************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/GridAttachmentType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

Identifies the cell or cells in a grid to which the item is attached by a reference to a specific cell coordinate in a grid or by identifying a range of values along a dimension.

AttachmentBase
**************

Type
    int
Cardinality
    0..1

If another response domain will be attached to the response domain listed withinResponseDomainInMixed provide a value in attachmentBase to allow for unique identification within this question grid. ResponseAttachmentLocation contains an attribute attachmentDomain which will provide a link from the domain that is being attached to the domain it is being attached to.
