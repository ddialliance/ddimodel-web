Maintainable
------------

Adds the attribute identifying this as a maintainable object. All content of Maintainable is considered to be administrative metadata. Note that changes to the administrative metadata does not drive a change in the version of the parent objects. All content of Maintainable with the exception of 'Note' is considered to be administrative metadata. Note that changes to the administrative metadata does not drive a change in the version of the parent objects. See DDI 3.2 Technical Documentation: Part I for further details.

Properties

Note
****

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/NoteType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Note allows for the attachment of a piece of additional information to any object with an ID. Note facilitates capturing temporary processing notes such as "Review and approval required". A single note can be attached to multiple objects by reference to the objects. Note may also contain content for a needed object that has been reported for addition in a later version of the schema. Ideally this should be handled by a local extension, but Note can accommodate run-time extensions when required. The Note should be housed within the Maintainable object that contains the referenced objects. In this way the user is ensured of receiving all known Note attachments when the maintainable content is delivered. This means that if a Note references objects within multiple Maintainable objects, the Note should be repeated in each Maintainable and reference only those objects with that Maintainable.

Software
********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/SoftwareType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Indicate the software used to create and/or manage the metadata. This is repeatable to allow for multiple softwares or multiple functions. If this information is important it is advisable to provide it in each maintainable so that it does not become separated from the internal content if the metadata is re-factored.

MetadataQuality
***************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/MetadataQualityType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

An assessment of the quality of the metadata within the Maintainable object, e.g. the quality of the transcription, completeness, editing status, etc.

ExternalReferenceDefaultURI
***************************

Type
    anyURI
Cardinality
    0..1

Use to provide a default value for the URI of external references. Use of a URI in a reference within this maintainable overrides the value entered here. Nested maintainables should redeclare the contents of this attribute for clarity.

Lang
****

Type
    language
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Attribute in http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace

This is used to designate the language of the metadata content of the maintainable. If a lower level xml:lang attribute conflicts with the content at the maintainable level, the object level value takes precedence.
