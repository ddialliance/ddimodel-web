DelimiterType
-------------

Defines the delimiter used to separate variables in a delimited record. Valid values include, space, tab, comma, semicolon, colon, pipe, and other. If "other" is used the characters used for separating (delimiting) objects should be entered in the attribute otherValue. Spaces and binary characters are not allowed. The attribute treatConsecutiveDelimiterAsOne indicates how consecutive delimiters should be handed by the software. The default value of "false" indicates that each delimiter should be treated as a valid delimiter.
