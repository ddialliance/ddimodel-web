PhysicalRecordSegmentType
-------------------------

A description of the physical record segment as found in the data store. A logical record may be stored in one or more segments housed hierarchically in a single file or in separate data files. All logical records have at least one segment. Identifies the Key variable identifying the segment if the identifier exists in the record, a file name identifier if the segment identification is expressed as part of the file name (used when each segment is stored in a separate file), the order of this segment in relation to other physical segments as part of the logical record, and a flag indicating whether or not the physical segment contains a key.

KeyVariableReference
********************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Variable/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicaldataproduct:3_2

Reference to the Unique key variable for segment identification.

FileNameIdentification
**********************

Type
    string
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicaldataproduct:3_2

If the file containing this segment has a standard section of its file name, include it here. For example a segment number. For example, in the files 2000SF10001.csv and 2000SF10002.csv the last 4 digits contain the segment number. There is no standard means of specifying this information in a machine-actionable way. This statement is informational but in some legacy files may be the only location where the segment identification is found.

SegmentOrder
************

Type
    int
Cardinality
    0..1

Indicates the position of this physical record segment within the logical record expressed as an integer.

HasSegmentKey
*************

Type
    boolean
Cardinality
    0..1

Set to "true" if there is a variable identifying the segment order. If true a segment key should be declared in a KeyVariableReference. Set to "false" if there are multiple segments and the identification of a particular segment is based on the order of the records within the file.
