AttachmentLocation
******************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/AttachmentLocationType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_2

Allows attachment of a secondary response domain to a specific item within another response domain used in the question. For example, attach a TextDomain to the value "Other" using the TextDomain label (Please specify) as a label for the TextDomain.

AttachmentBase
**************

Type
    int
Cardinality
    0..1

If another response domain will be attached to the response domain listed withinResponseDomainInMixed provide a value in attachmentBase to allow for unique identification within this question. AttachmentLocation contains an attribute attachmentDomain which will provide a link from the domain that is being attached to the domain it is being attached to.
