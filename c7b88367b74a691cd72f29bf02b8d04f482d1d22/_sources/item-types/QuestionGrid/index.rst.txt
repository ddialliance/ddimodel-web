QuestionGrid
------------

Structures the QuestionGrid as an NCube-like structure providing dimension information, labeling options, and response domains attached to one or more cells within the grid. Provides the intent of the QuestionGrid, input and output parameters for the grid, the question text for the grid, details on the dimensions, allowed responses, and additional cell contents of the grid, references to external aids and instructions, and an estimate of the time required to complete the grid. Note that the QuestionGrid is a reusable format for use in any number of applied uses. External aids, instructions, response sequencing etc. should contain information consistent with the general use of the QuestionGrid. Additional materials and information can be added within the QuestionConstruct which is the applied use of a question.

QuestionGridName
****************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

A name for the QuestionGrid. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A display label for the QuestionGrid. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A description of the QuestionGrid. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

InParameter
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/InParameterType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Provides an identity for input objects required for the QuestionGrid.

OutParameter
************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/ParameterType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Provides an identify for the output objects of the QuestionGrid.

Binding
*******

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/BindingType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A structure used to bind the content of a parameter declared as the source to a parameter declared as the target. For example, binding the OutParameter of one Question to the InParameter of another Question in order to personalize a question text. Care should be taken to bind only reusable information at this level. Binding is also available at the QuestionConstruct to reflect bindings particular to the use of the question in a specific question flow or instrument.

QuestionText
************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/DynamicTextType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

The text of a question. Supports the use of DynamicText. Note that when using QuestionText, the full QuestionText must be repeated for multi-language versions of the content. Different languages may handle the dynamic portions in different locations and/or with different content. Therefore languages cannot be mixed within a dynamic text except when the full text itself has multiple language sections, for example, a foreign language term in a text. The DisplayText may also be repeated to provide a dynamic and plain text version of the display. This allows for accurate rendering of the QuestionText in a non-dynamic environment like print.

QuestionIntent
**************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

The purpose of the QuestionGrid in terms of what it is designed to test. May contain information on specific aspects of the Grid and its construction. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

GridDimension
*************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/GridDimensionType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

Describes each dimension of the grid including dimension rank (for the purpose of identifying a cell address), a text for the dimension, and optional labels and codes used as column and row stubs. May also describe a roster (a set of unlabeled rows or columns depending upon display situation).

ResponseDomain
**************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/RepresentationType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

Contains a response domain for the question grid. All cells in the grid have the same response domain. Any cell may also contain an internal label.

ResponseDomainReference
***********************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/ManagedRepresentation/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

The inclusion of a response domain by reference (must be supported by a managed representation). An abstract element. May be substituted by any valid object of substitution type DomainReference.

    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredMixedGridResponseDomainType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3
