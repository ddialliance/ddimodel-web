ReferenceWithBindingType
------------------------

A reference to an object containing a Binding, e.g. a GeneralInstruction, GenerationInstruction, ControlConstruct, etc. The basic Reference structure is extended to allow for the use of Binding to link specific OutParameters and InParameter at the point of use. If there is a conflict between a Binding in the reference and the Binding information provided in the object of the reference, the Binding information in the reference overrides that found in the object of the reference.

A structure used to link the content of a parameter declared as the source to a parameter declared as the target. For example, linking the output of a question to the input of a generation instruction. Question A has an OutParameter X. Generation Instruction has an InParameter Y used in the recode instruction. Binding defines the content of InParameter Y to be whatever is provided by OutParameter X for use in the calculation of the recode.
