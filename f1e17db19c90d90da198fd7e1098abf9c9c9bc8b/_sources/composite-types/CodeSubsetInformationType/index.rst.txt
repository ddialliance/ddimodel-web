CodeSubsetInformationType
-------------------------

Allows further specification of the codes to use from the CodeList by defining the level or only the most discrete codes of a hierarchical CodeList, the range of codes to use, or an itemized sub-set.

Type
    nonNegativeInteger
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace

Identifies the specific level to include using the levelNumber. Repeat if more than one level is included.

    :doc:`/composite-types/IncludedCodeType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Specifies the codes to include in the representation.

DataExistence

Use when only the lowest, most discrete codes in the CodeList will be expressed as valid values. Identifies those levels of a CodeList with a regular hierarchy or those indicates discrete codes within an irregular hierarchy. All other codes will be used as labels within the hierarchy to clearly express content, but will not be valid as a response or representation value.
