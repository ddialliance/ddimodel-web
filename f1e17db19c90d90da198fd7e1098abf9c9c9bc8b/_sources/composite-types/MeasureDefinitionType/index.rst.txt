MeasureDefinitionType
---------------------

Defines the structure and type of measure captured within the cells. This may be repeated to describe multiple measure for the cells (i.e., count, percent of universe, dimensional percent, index, text, suppression flag, etc.). Includes a reference to the defining variable and an optional aggregation definition for use in defining content relying on the use of independent and dependent variables (such as the percentage of a specific dimension (like a row or column percent on a table).
