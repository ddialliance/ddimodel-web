NCubeGroup
----------

Contains a group of NCubes, which may be ordered or hierarchical. In addition to the name, label, and description of the group, the structure allows for defining the type of group using an optional controlled vocabulary, a reference to a defining universe or concept for the group, and a listing of NCubes and NCubeGroups in any order.

TypeOfNCubeGroup
****************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:logicalproduct:3_3

A brief textual identification of the group type. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary.

NCubeGroupName
**************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:logicalproduct:3_3

A name for the NCubeGroup. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A display label for the NCubeGroup. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A description of the content and purpose of the NCubeGroup. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

UniverseReference
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Universe/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the universe statement describing the persons or other objects to which the contents of this NCube group pertain.

ConceptReference
****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Concept/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the concept expressed by the NCubes in this group.

Subject
*******

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/InternationalCodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

If subjects are listed for this group, it is strongly recommended that the subjects listed also be found in the TopicalCoverage element for the parent packaging element when this group is included directly or by reference in a module containing a coverage element. Use of subject at the group level allows for associating objects as a type of subject based group or to identify subject characteristics of a reusable group of objects.

Keyword
*******

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/InternationalCodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

If keywords are listed for this group, it is strongly recommended that the keywords listed also be found in the TopicalCoverage element for the parent packaging element when this group is included directly or by reference in a module containing a coverage element. Use of keyword at the group level allows for associating objects as a type of keyword based group or to identify keyword characteristics of a reusable group of objects.

NCubeReference
**************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/NCube/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to constituent NCube.

NCubeGroupReference
*******************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/NCubeGroup/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:logicalproduct:3_3

Reference to constituent NCubeGroup. This allows for nesting of NCubeGroups.

IsOrdered
*********

Type
    boolean
Cardinality
    0..1

If set to "true" indicates that the content of the group is ordered as it appears within the XML structure.
