Variable
--------

Describes the structure of a Variable. This is the applied expression of a data item within a data set and maps to the GSIM ImplementedVariable. In addition to the standard name, label, and description, includes a reference to a source parameter, represented variable, conceptual variable, universe, concept, question, source variable, and embargo information. It identifies the normal source of the data in the variable, the unit of analysis, whether the variable provides temporal or geographic information, or serves as a weight for other variables in the data, and provides a full description of its representation.

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:logicalproduct:3_3

A name for the Variable. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label

    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Assigns a parameter that contains output from the Variable so that it can be bound to an InParameter of an instruction or act as the SourceParameter of another Variable.

SourceParameterReference

    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to variable(s) used as a basis for recoding, derivation, or other means of calculating the data for this variable. This reference is intended to provide basic information on the source variable structure including value representation, measurement unit, etc. Note that if a variable is used by reference within multiple VariableSchemes you can identify its role within a specific VariableScheme by including that VariableScheme in the sourceContext attribute of the reference. Use ProcessingInstructionReference to provide additional information on the transformation of the source variable(s) into the data for this variable. If additional processing detail is required use the InParameter, OutParameter, and ParameterLinkage options in the GenerationInstruction and ProcessingInstructionReference.

RepresentedVariableReference

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the RepresentedVariable that describes the core of this variable (the RepresentedVariable that the variable is the implementation of). The RepresentedVariable contains the broad reusable specification of the Variable, i.e., concept, universe, and value representation. These may be constrained by specifications within the Variable description. TypeOfObject should be set to RepresentedVariable.

Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the universe statement containing a description of the persons or other elements that this variable refers to, and to which any analytic results refer. If more than one universe is referenced the universe of the variable is the intersect of the referenced universes.
