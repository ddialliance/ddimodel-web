IfThenElse
----------

A member of the ControlConstruct substitution group. Describes an if-then-else decision type of control construct. IF the stated condition is met, the THEN clause is trigged, otherwise the ELSE clause is triggered. Contains an IfCondition (the condition that must be met to trigger the Then clause), a ThenConstructReference (indicating the construct to invoke if the condition is met), an ElseConstructReference (indicating the construct to invoke if the condition is not met), and an ElseIf structure allowing the expression of multiple conditions to invoke multiple branching.

A brief textual identification of the IfThenElse. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary.

Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

The condition which must be met to trigger the Then clause, expressed as a CommandCode. The condition is an expression in the programming language used in the instrument.

Reference to the control construct which should be triggered if the associated condition is met.

Use for multiple branching from a single point in the flow logic represented by the flow logic If, Then, ElseIf, Then, etc.
