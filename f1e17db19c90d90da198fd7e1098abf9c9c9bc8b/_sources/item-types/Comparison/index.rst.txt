Comparison
----------

A maintainable module containing maps between objects of the same or similar type. Maps allow for pair-wise mapping of two objects by describing their similarities and differences in order to make assertions regarding their comparability. Currently maps allow for the comparison of concepts, variables, questions, categories, universes, and representations that have managed content (code, category, numeric, text, datetime and scale). These mapping(s) inform users on the comparability of two objects and facilitate automation. Note that all maps are pairwise, identifying two schemes and the correlation between two items in those schemes. Due to the complexity of some objects, multiple mappings may be required to cover details of the comparison of component parts, e.g. a QuestionMap may also have a related RepresentationMap. By using a set of pairwise comparisons, it is possible to describe complex correspondences - pairwise comparisons are easier to process. In addition to providing a standard name, label, and description, Comparison consists of a simple stack of comparison maps. Comparison maps are currently limited to those objects that can be referenced and are sufficiently structured to support a clear comparison.

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:comparative:3_3

A name for the comparison. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

A display label for the comparison. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Maps between any two managed representations. In addition to representation types held in a ManagedRepresentationScheme, managed representations include CategoryScheme and coded representations which include CodeList, GeographicStructureCode or GeographicLocationCode. Note that the source can be any managed representation including a CodeList, GeographicStructure or GeographicLocation. Note that comparisons between two category schemes is best handled by CategoryMap.

Maps the content of two different universe schemes of objects of the same type providing detail for the comparable items within those two schemes.
