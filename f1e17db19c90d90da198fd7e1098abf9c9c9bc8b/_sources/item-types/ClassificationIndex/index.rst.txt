ClassificationIndex
-------------------

A Classification Index is an ordered list (alphabetical, in code order etc) of Classification Index Entries. A Classification Index can relate to one particular or to several Statistical Classifications.
A Classification Index shows the relationship between text found in statistical data sources (responses to survey questionnaires, administrative records) and one or more Statistical Classifications. A Classification Index may be used to assign the codes for Classification Items to observations in statistical collections.

A Classification Index can exist in several languages. Indicates the languages available. If a Classification Index exists in several languages, the number of entries in each language may be different, as the number of terms describing the same phenomenon can change from one language to another. However, the same phenomena should be described in each language.
