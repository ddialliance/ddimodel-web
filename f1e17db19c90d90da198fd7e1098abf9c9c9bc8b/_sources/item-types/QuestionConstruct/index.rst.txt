QuestionConstruct
-----------------

A member of the ControlConstruct substitution group. A construct which ties question content to the programmatic logic of the control constructs. Contains a reference to a QuestionItem, QuestionGrid or QuestionBlock, can set response or dimension sequence for use in a specific application, identifies the response unit, analysis unit, and universe. May provide an estimate of the number of minutes needed to respond.

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Question/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to a QuestionItem, QuestionGrid, or QuestionBlock.

ResponseSequence
****************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/SpecificSequenceType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

Describes the sequencing of the response options to the question for this application.

DimensionSequence
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/SpecificSequenceType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

Describes the sequencing of the dimension within a QuestionGrid for this application.

ResponseUnit
************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

Identifies the intended Response unit (respondent). Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary.

AnalysisUnit
************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

The analysis unit, expressed as a term which may come from a controlled vocabulary.

UniverseReference
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Universe/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the universe statement containing a description of the persons or other elements that this variable refers to, and to which any analytic results refer. If more than one universe is referenced the universe of the variable is the intersect of the referenced universes.

EstimatedSecondsResponseTime
****************************

Type
    decimal
Cardinality
    0..1

The estimated amount of time required to answer a question expressed in seconds. Decimal values should be used to define fractions of seconds. At the question construct level it refers to the estimated time within the context of is use in a questionnaire.
