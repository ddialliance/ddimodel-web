Instruction
-----------

Provides the content and description of a single instruction. In addition to the standard name, label, and description, an InParameter can be designated to specify information needed to process the dynamic content of the instruction, an image can be associated with the instruction, and the instruction text provided using DynamicText. Note that when using Dynamic Text, the full InstructionText must be repeated for multi-language versions of the content. Different languages may handle the dynamic portions in different locations and/or with different content. Therefore languages cannot be mixed within a dynamic text except when the full text itself has multiple language sections, for example, a foreign language term in a text. The InstructionText may also be repeated to provide a dynamic and plain text version of the instruction. This allows for accurate rendering of the instruction in a non-dynamic environment like print.

InstructionName
***************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

A name for the Instruction. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A display label for the Instruction. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A description of the content and purpose of the Instruction. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

InParameter
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/InParameterType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A parameter that may accept content from outside the Instruction. In addition to standard parameter content may provide the instructions for limiting the allowable array index.

AssociatedImage
***************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/ImageType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

An image associated with the Instruction, located at the provided URN or URL.

InstructionText
***************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/DynamicTextType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

The content of the Instruction text provided using DynamicText. Note that when using Dynamic Text, the full InstructionText must be repeated for multi-language versions of the content. The InstructionText may also be repeated to provide a dynamic and plain text version of the instruction. This allows for accurate rendering of the instruction in a non-dynamic environment like print.
