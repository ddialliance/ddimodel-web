PhysicalStructureScheme
-----------------------

A scheme containing a set of PhysicalStructures containing descriptions of overall structure of a physical data storage format. These descriptions provide the primary link to the LogicalRecord found in the data file, general structural information such as use of proprietary storage structures, division of logical records into physical segment, and default values for decimal separators, etc. Each description can apply to one or more data files containing the same logical records in the same overall structure. In addition to the standard name, label, and description, it allows for inclusion of an existing PhysicalStructureScheme by reference, and PhysicalStructure or PhysicalStructureGroup descriptions in-line or by reference.

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicaldataproduct:3_3

A name for the PhysicalStructureScheme. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A display label for the PhysicalStructureScheme. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A description of the PhysicalStructureScheme. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/PhysicalStructureScheme/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to an existing PhysicalStructureScheme for inclusion.

PhysicalStructureReference

Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicaldataproduct:3_3

A PhysicalStructure description providing the primary link to the LogicalRecord and general structural information. Each description can apply to one or more data files containing the same logical records in the same overall structure.
