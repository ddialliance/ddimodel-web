ClassificationLevel
-------------------

A Statistical Classification has a structure which is composed of one or several Levels. A Level often is associated with a concept, which defines it. In a hierarchical Statistical Classification the Classification Items of each Level but the highest are aggregated to the nearest higher Level. A linear Statistical Classification has only one Level.

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:logicalproduct:3_3

Indicates whether the code at the Level is alphabetical, numerical or alphanumerical. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary.

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:logicalproduct:3_3

Indicates how the code at the Level is constructed of numbers, letters and separators. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary.

DummyCode
*********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:logicalproduct:3_3

Rule for the construction of dummy codes from the codes of the next higher Level (used when one or several categories are the same in two consecutive Levels). Supports the use of multiple languages and structured content.

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Concept/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A concept which describes the level. TypeOfObject should be set to Concept.
