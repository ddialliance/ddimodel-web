RepresentedVariable
-------------------

Describes a RepresentedVariable contained in the RepresentedVariableScheme. In addition to the standard name, label, and description a RepresentedVariable contains a reference to the Concept and Universe (or ConceptualVariable) as well as the representation of the RepresentedVariable. Representation may be provided in-line or by reference to a managed representation. RepresentedVariables are the core reusable parts of a Variable. RepresentedVariable maps to the GSIM Represented Variable. In addition to the standard name, label, and description

RepresentedVariableName
***********************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:logicalproduct:3_3

A name for the RepresentedVariable. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A display label for the RepresentedVariable. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A description of the RepresentedVariable. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

ConceptualVariableReference
***************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/ConceptualVariable/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A reference to a ConceptualVariable which provides the linkage to the Universe and Concept used by this RepresentedVariable. TypeOfObject should be set to ConceptualVariable.

UnitTypeReference
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/UnitType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the unit type containing a description of the unit type that this RepresentedVariable refers to, and to which any analytic results refer. TypeOfObject should be set to UnitType.

ConceptReference
****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Concept/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the concept measured by this RepresentedVariable. TypeOfObject should be set to Concept.

CategorySchemeReference
***********************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/CategoryScheme/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

DEPRECATED. DDI strongly recommends use of the CategorySchemeReference provided by the ConceptualVariable. Reference to a category scheme that contains the representation domain of the RepresentedVariable. Use this element when only the category specifications are provided. If both a code and the related category must be specified use CodeRepresentation (member of the substitution group ValueRepresentation). TypeOfObject should be set to CategoryScheme.

ValueRepresentation
*******************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/RepresentationType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Describes the actual representation of the RepresentedVariables' values. ValueRepresentation is the head of a substitution group which supports a number of representation types, i.e. CodeRepresentation, NumericRepresentation, TextRepresentation, DateTimeRepresentation, ScaleRepresentation, GeographicStructureCodeRepresentation, and GeographicLocationCodeRepresentation. Although the structure allows for specification of missing values these features should be used with caution. Like the definition of the universe and concept, the specification of the representation can be constrained by the Variable (the GSIM ImplementedVariable), for example a NumericRepresentation could be constrained with a lower top coding specification. Missing Values can be assigned separately by the Variable without impact on the ValueRepresentation of the specified valid values provided here.

ValueRepresentationReference
****************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/ManagedRepresentation/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Allows for the use of managed value representations by reference. ValueRepresentationReference is the head of a substitution group which supports a number of representation types not managed within existing schemes, i.e. ManagedNumericRepresentation, ManagedTextRepresentation, ManagedDateTimeRepresentation, and ManagedScaleRepresentation. TypeOfObject should be set to ManagedNumericRepresentation, ManagedTextRepresentation, ManagedDateTimeRepresentation, or ManagedScaleRepresentation.
