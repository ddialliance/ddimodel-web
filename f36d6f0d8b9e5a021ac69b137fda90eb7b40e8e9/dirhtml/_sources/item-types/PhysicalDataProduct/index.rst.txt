PhysicalDataProduct
-------------------

A module describing the physical storage structures of data files and the relationship of their internal objects to the logical (intellectual) description of the objects found in LogicalProduct. This describes the physical aspects of data files which may be common between one or more data files as described by physical structure of the file and the structure of data items within a record. The PhysicalDataProduct contains the critical links between the physical data store identified by a PhysicalInstance and the logical (intellectual) description of the data as found in the LogicalProduct. In addition to the standard name, label, and description, the module allows for OtherMaterial, and descriptions of PhysicalStructureSchemes and RecordLayoutSchemes in-line or by reference.

***********************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicaldataproduct:3_2

A name for the PhysicalDataProduct module. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

A display label for the PhysicalDataProduct module. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

A description of the PhysicalDataProduct module. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

OtherMaterial
*************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/OtherMaterialType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

References other resources related to the described physical data product.

PhysicalStructureSchemeReference
********************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/PhysicalStructureScheme/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicaldataproduct:3_2

A scheme containing a set of PhysicalStructures containing descriptions of overall structure of a physical data storage format. These descriptions provide the primary link to the LogicalRecord found in the data file, general structural information such as use of proprietary storage structures, division of logical records into physical segment, and default values for decimal separators, etc. Each description can apply to one or more data files containing the same logical records in the same overall structure.

RecordLayoutSchemeReference
***************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/RecordLayoutScheme/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicaldataproduct:3_2

A scheme containing a set of RecordLayouts describing the location of individual data items within the physical record and how to address them (locate and retrieve). RecordLayouts provide a link to the PhysicalStructure description and to individual variables or NCubes describing the data items.
