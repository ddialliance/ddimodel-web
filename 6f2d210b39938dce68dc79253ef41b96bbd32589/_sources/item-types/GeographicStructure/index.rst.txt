GeographicStructureName
***********************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

A name for the GeographicStructure. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

A display label for the GeographicStructure. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

A description of the GeographicStructure. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

AuthorizedSource
****************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/AuthorizedSourceType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

An identifiable authorization source repeated for each identifying code type. This allows the codes to be used as representations for response domains and value representations by designating a specific set of locations and the code of an authorization source. An authorization source should differentiate between codes derived for different purposes within the same agency.

GeographicLevel
***************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/GeographicLevelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

Used to describe any level of geography, including overall coverage and each of the lower levels.

GeographicLevelReference
************************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/GeographicLevelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

Inclusion of an existing GeographicLevel description by reference.
