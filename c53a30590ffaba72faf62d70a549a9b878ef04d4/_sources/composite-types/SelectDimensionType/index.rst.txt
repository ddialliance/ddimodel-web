SelectDimensionType
-------------------

For each dimension in the grid define the applicable values as "all values", a "specific value" or a range. If a rangeMinimum or rangeMaximum is provided without the other, the assumption is unbounded for the object not included.

   "Rank","nonNegativeInteger","1..1","The rank value of the dimension for which the selection criteria apply."
   "AllValues","boolean","0..1","If set to ""true"" applies to the full set of dimension values. If set to ""false"" use specificValue, rangeMinimum and rangeMaximum as appropriate to define the subset of values needed."
   "SpecificValue","string","0..1","May contain a single value or a delimited array of values."
   "RangeMinimum","string","0..1","The inclusive minimum value of the range. Use when the values or subset of values are ordered and contiguous and may be expressed as a range."
   "RangeMaximum","string","0..1","The inclusive maximum value of the range. Use when the values or subset of values are ordered and contiguous and may be expressed as a range."
