SubGroup
--------

The subgroup element is a container for a group that is a child of a higher-level group described in this module, but may also be a parent to other (subordinate) groups. A studyunit can be fully described, or just referenced, within its subgroup container. The purpose of sub-groups is described using the attributes which summarize relationships along the dimensions of time, panel, geography, instrument and language. These attributes allow the purpose to be machine-actionable, while the sub-group also includes an element for describing the purpose in human-readable format. A SubGroup contains a Citation, Abstract, information on authorization, the universe of the sub-group, series statement, quality statements, funding information, purpose, coverage, analysis units covered, kind of data, other materials, and embargo information. It then allows all maintainable structures within the StudyUnit to be expressed at the SubGroup level.

Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

An abstract of the sub-group unit describing the nature and scope of the data collection, special characteristics of its content. Note that detailed information on the purpose of the sub-group and structured coverage information are to be entered in Purpose and Coverage.

UniverseReference
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Universe/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

Reference to the universe statement from the universe scheme, describing the sub-group of persons or other elements that are the object of research and to which any analytic results refer. Age, nationality, and residence commonly help to delineate a given universe, but any of a number of factors may be involved, such as sex, race, income, veteran status, criminal convictions, etc. The universe may consist of elements other than persons, such as housing units, court cases, deaths, countries, etc. In general, it should be possible to tell from the description of the universe whether a given individual or element (hypothetical or real) is a member of the population under sub-group. A universe may be described as "inclusive" or "exclusive". This sub-group level reference is normally to the top level of the UniverseScheme.

SeriesStatement

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

A sub-group, particularly one in a series, may be the result of two series merging into a single sub-group. The new sub-group belongs to both series. For example, Niger now fields the UNICEF Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS) and the Demographic and Health Survey as a single merged instrument.
