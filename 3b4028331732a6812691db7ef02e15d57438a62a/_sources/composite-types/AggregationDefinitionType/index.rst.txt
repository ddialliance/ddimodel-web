Properties

IndependentDimension
********************

Type
    int
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:logicalproduct:3_2

The rank of a dimension that acts as the denominator (independent variable).

DependentDimension
******************

Type
    int
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:logicalproduct:3_2

The rank of a dimension that acts as the numerator (dependent variable).

IsNCubeUniverse
***************

Type
    boolean
Cardinality
    0..1

When true indicates that total count of the NCube as described by the universe acts as the independent variable (denominator) and that all dimensions are used to define the dependent variable (numerator). When false, use the IndependentDimension and DependentDimension elements to assign each rank to its appropriate role.
