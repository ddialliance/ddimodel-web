TypeOfInstructionGroup
**********************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_2

A generic element for specifying a reason for a InstructionGroup. Note that this element can contain either a term from a controlled vocabulary list or a textual description.

InstructionGroupName
********************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_2

A name for the group. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

A display label for the InstructionGroup. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

A description of the content and purpose of the InstructionGroup. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

UniverseReference
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Universe/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

Reference to the universe statement describing the persons or other objects to which the contents of this group pertain.

ConceptReference
****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Concept/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

Reference to the concept expressed by the objects in this group.

Subject
*******

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/InternationalCodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

If subjects are listed for this group, it is strongly recommended that the subjects listed also be found in the TopicalCoverage element for the parent packaging element when this group is included directly or by reference in a module containing a coverage element. Use of subject at the group level allows for associating objects as a type of subject based group or to identify subject characteristics of a reusable group of objects.

Keyword
*******

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/InternationalCodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_2

If keywords are listed for this group, it is strongly recommended that the keywords listed also be found in the TopicalCoverage element for the parent packaging element when this group is included directly or by reference in a module containing a coverage element. Use of keyword at the group level allows for associating objects as a type of keyword based group or to identify keyword characteristics of a reusable group of objects.

InstructionReference
********************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Instruction/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_2

Reference to constituent Instruction (from the substitution group). TypeOfObject should be set to Instruction.

InstructionGroupReference
*************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/InstructionGroup/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_2

Reference to constituent InstructionGroup. This allows for nesting of InstructionGroups. TypeOfObject should be set to InstructionGroup.

*********

Type
    boolean
Cardinality
    0..1

If set to "true" indicates that the content of the group is ordered as it appears within the XML structure.
