Universe
--------

Describes a universe which may also be known as a population. A Universe describes the "object" of a Data Element Concept or Data Element as defined by ISO/IEC 11179. A universe may be organized into hierarchical sub-universes. In addition to the standard name, label, and description, the universe may provide a generation code (how the universe is differentiated or split out from another universe), a definition of hierarchical sub-settings for the universe, and an attribute that indicates if the description of the universe is stated in terms of what the universe includes.

Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:conceptualcomponent:3_3

A name for the Universe. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A display label for the Universe. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

    :doc:`/item-types/UnitType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to a unit type being associated with this conceptual variable. TypeOfObject should be set to UnitType.

    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:conceptualcomponent:3_3

The entity type associated with this conceptual variable. For example, individuals, families or households, groups, institutions/organizations, administrative units, etc. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary.

    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:conceptualcomponent:3_3

Reference to specific time period for the Universe. Repeat for non-continuous time periods.

UniverseGenerationCode
**********************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/CommandCodeType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:conceptualcomponent:3_3

An expression of the universe in terms of the code used to generate or define it. For example how a given universe may be differentiated within a parent universe.

SubUniverseClassReference
*************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/SubUniverseClass/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:conceptualcomponent:3_3

A sub-universe class provides a definition to the universes contained within it. For example the Sub-Universe Class of Gender for the Universe Resident Population may contain the Universe Males and the Universe Females

IsInclusive
***********

Type
    boolean
Cardinality
    0..1

The default value is "true". The description statement of a universe is generally stated in inclusive terms such as "All persons residing in Europe". Occasionally a universe is defined by what it excludes, i.e., "All persons residing in Europe except for those residing on U.S. Military bases". In this case the value would be changed to "false".
