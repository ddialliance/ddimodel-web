LabelType
---------

A structured display label for the element. Label provides display content of a fully human readable display for the identification of the element. DDI does not impose any length limitations on Label. If length of Label is constrained due to use of the element in a specific application, the maximum length supported should be noted in the attribute maxLength. TypeOfLabel should be used to indicate the application either directly or as an identified type, such as “systems with an 8 character label length limitation”. The label may also indicate its applicability to a specific locale using the attribute locationVariant. Label may be repeated to provide content for different uses or situations. Language variants should be made within the Label using the internal structure of the Structured String type. The assumption is that replication of Label is done to provide different intellectual content or content specific to differing systems or applications.

A brief description of the label type. Supports the use of a controlled vocabulary.
