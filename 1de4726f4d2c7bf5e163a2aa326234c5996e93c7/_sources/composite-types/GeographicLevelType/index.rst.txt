GeographicLevelType
-------------------

Describes a level within the GeographicStructure. In addition to a name and description, provides one or more GeographicLevelCodes by which it is identified with specified system, any coverage limitations, and parent position within a single hierarchy or if it is the result of layering multiple hierarchies, the lowest component level for each of the layering hierarchies. Allows for an indicator declaring that coverage of the parent level is or is not exhaustive.

GeographicLevelName
*******************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A name for the GeographicLevel. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A description of the GeographicLevel. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

GeographicLevelCode
*******************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A code and its authorization source for identifying the level within a specific system.

CoverageLimitation
******************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/InternationalStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Describes a limitation of the coverage such as all objects of a specific type that meet population size requirements (i.e., All Places with a population of 10,000 or more).

PrimaryComponentLevel
*********************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/PrimaryComponentLevelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Provides references to the base level elements that are used as building blocks for composed geographies. For example, Metropolitan areas that are composed of counties except in the New England States where they are composed of county subdivisions, or School Attendance Boundaries (SABINS) built from Census Blocks. This structure allows for specifying the basic building block for composed areas and any restrictions (coverage limitations). The field may be repeated to provide alternate information on the basic building blocks for areas outside of the coverage limitations described.

ParentGeographicLevelReference
******************************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/GeographicLevelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to a single containing (parent) geography.

GeographicLayerBaseReference
****************************

Type

Cardinality
    2..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Use for geographic polygons that are the result of layering two or more geographic hierarchies where the polygon being described is the intersect of the layers. For example: State - County - County Subdivision - Place/Remainder - Tract [The portion of a tract that is within a single place (or non-place area) and a single county subdivision] This polygon is made by overlaying the following three geographic hierarchies: 1) State - Place, 2) State - County - Tract, and 3) State - County - Subdivision. The three GeographicLayerBase elements would point to Tract, Place, and County Subdivision.
