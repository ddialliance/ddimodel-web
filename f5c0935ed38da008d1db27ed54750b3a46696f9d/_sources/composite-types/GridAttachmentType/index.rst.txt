SpecificCellCoordinate
**********************

Type
    string
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

Defines a single cell by its matrix coordinate address. For example "1,3,2" for a 3 dimensional matrix where dimension rank-1 has a value of 1, dimension rank-2 has a value of 3, and dimension rank-3 has a value of 2.

CellCoordinatesAsDefined
************************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/CellCoordinatesAsDefinedType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

Defines one or more cells by defining the applicable values of each dimension as "all values", a "specific value" or a range. For example in a simple 2 dimensional grid where dimension rank-1 is displayed as rows and dimension rank-2 as columns and the first column contains a NumericDomain; SelectDimension rank="1" allValues="true" and SelectDimension rank="2" specificValue="1" would result in the NumericDomain being attached to the first column of the grid only.

AllCells
********

Type
    boolean
Cardinality
    0..1

If the item should be attached to all the cells in the grid set this attribute to "true".
