The condition on which the associated text varies expressed by an IfThenElse decision tree. For example, If MEMBER = 1, Then = [ConditionalResult singular], ElseIf MEMBER > 1, Then = [ConditionalResult plural].  Use InParameter and OutParameter of parent class to associate Parameters to Alias values in the IfCondition.

This allows for the simple insert of a piece of information from another specified parameter.
