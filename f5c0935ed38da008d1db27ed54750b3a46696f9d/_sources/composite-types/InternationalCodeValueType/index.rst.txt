InternationalCodeValueType
--------------------------

Allows for string content which may be taken from an externally maintained controlled vocabulary. If the content is from a controlled vocabulary provide the code value, as well as a reference to the code list from which the value is taken. This differs from a CodeValue only by the provision of a language-location specification. DDI uses the International CodeValue in cases where controlled vocabularies are assumed to be highly language specific, such as nationally maintained subject headings, thesauri, or keywords derived from the content of documents. The ability to identify language is especially important when supporting searches by external language-specific search engines. Provide as many of the identifying attributes as needed to adequately identify the controlled vocabulary.
