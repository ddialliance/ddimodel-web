NCubeInstanceT
--------------

A container for defining an instance of an NCube, indicating the matrix address of each cell and where the data for each measure within a cell of the NCube is stored. Allows specifying the values of the attributes attached to a NCube.

   :widths: 15,10,5,100

   "NCubeReference",":doc:`/item-types/NCube/index`","0..1","Reference to the logical NCube description."
   "MeasureDimension",":doc:`/composite-types/MeasureDimensionType/index`","0..1","This element defines the structure of a measure dimension for the NCube Instance. A value along the MeasureDimension is defined by a stack of references to one or more MeasureDefinitions found in the logical description of the NCube with each containing an attribute of orderValue which provides its value for use in the cell address (similar to the use of a CodeRepresentation of a Variable used as a conceptual dimension. This allows measures (whether one or several) to be handled in the same way as the conceptual dimension of the NCube in declaring a cell address. It is assumed that the value of the MeasureDimension is the last value in the address array. For example, for an NCube with 3 conceptual dimensions of rank 1 = Sex, rank 2 = Age, and rank 3 = Educational Attainment, plus a MeasureDimension. The cell address of 1,4,2,2 would indicate Code value of 1 for Sex, 4 for Age, 2 for Educational Attainment, and 2 for MeasureDimension. For systems translating to SDMX or an OLap structure DDI assumes that the MeasureDefinitionReference with the orderValue=""1"" is the equivalent of the PrimaryMeasure."
   "AttachedAttributeT",":doc:`/composite-types/AttachedAttributeTType/index`","0..n","This is an attribute attached to the NCube as a whole or a region of the NCube as defined in the logical description as a CoordinateRegion. The content of the attribute can be provided as a single value or reference a location in the data store where the attribute value will be found. This may be in addition to attribute information described in the logical structure."
   "DataItemT",":doc:`/composite-types/DataItemTType/index`","0..n","Describes a single data item or cell within an NCube Instance. It defines its location within the NCube by its coordinate (matrix) address which is its intersect point on each dimension. Allows for the specification of data item specific attributes, and identifies the physical location of each measure for the data item. May optionally indicate the language of the data contents."
   "DefaultDataType",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","An explicit definition of the data type that is applied to the majority of the data items reducing the amount of repetitive markup required. It can be overridden at the data item level. This field is necessary in the case of some numeric data formats where the format definition would allow real values, but the values are integer values. Allowed values are: integer (default), real, string."
   "DefaultDelimiter",":doc:`/composite-types/DelimiterType/index`","0..1","Delimiter definition for delimited (free field) data that is applied to the majority of the data items reducing the amount of repetitive markup required. It can be overridden at the data item level. Allowed values are: Empty (default), Tab, Blank, AnyString. If a delimiter is used, free field (delimited data) is assumed; binary formats are not allowed."
   "DefaultDecimalPositions","`int <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#int>`_","0..1","Number of decimal places for data with an implied decimal separator that is applied to the majority of the data items reducing the amount of repetitive markup required. It can be overridden at the data item level. Another expression is the decimal scaling factor (SAS). Default: 0."
   "DefaultDecimalSeparator","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","0..1","The character used to separate the integer and the fraction part of a number (if an explicit separator is used in the data) that is applied to the majority of the data items reducing the amount of repetitive markup required. It can be overridden at the data item level. Allowed values are: None (default), Dot, Comma, Other. On the basis of the data definition in DDI documents, data processing tools could compute the necessary precision width on the basis of the format width and the existence of separators. Appropriate data types could be used, i.e. float or double, short or long. The decimal separator definition only makes sense with some XML Schema primitives. This is a default which may be overridden in specific cases."
   "DefaultDigitGroupSeparator","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","0..1","The character used to separate groups of digits (if an explicit separator is used in the data) that is applied to the majority of the data items reducing the amount of repetitive markup required. It can be overridden at the data item level. Allowed values are: None (default), Dot, Comma, Other. The decimal separator definition makes only sense with some XML Schema primitives. This is a default which may be overridden in specific cases."
   "NumberOfCases","`nonNegativeInteger <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#nonnegativeinteger>`_","0..1","Total number of cases represented by the contents of the NCube. This is normally the sum of the cell contents when the NCube contains counts and sub-totals are not included."

   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
   "VersionResponsibility","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","0..1","Person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, it may be included in this notation. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionResponsibilityReference",":doc:`/item-types/Agent/index`","0..1","Reference person or organization within the MaintenanceAgency responsible for the version change, as described in an OrganizationScheme. If it is important to retain the affiliation between and individual responsible for the version and his/her agency, a Relation should be created between the individual referenced here and his/her organization. This is primarily intended for internal use."
   "VersionRationale",":doc:`/composite-types/VersionRationaleType/index`","0..1","Textual description of the rationale/purpose for the version change and a coded value to provide an internal processing flag within and organization or system. Note that versioning can only take place on objects owned by the specified DDI Agency. If you are creating a local instance of an object from another agency for current or future modification use BasedOnObject. If the changes being made result in what you determine to be new object rather than a version of a previous object, i.e. the change is too extensive to consider it a version of the existing object, create a new object and use BasedOnObject to provide a link to the object or objects that were a basis for the new object."
   "BasedOnObject",":doc:`/composite-types/BasedOnObjectType/index`","0..1","Use when creating an object that is based on an existing object or objects that are managed by a different agency or when the new object is NOT simply a version change but you wish to maintain a reference to the object that served as a basis for the new object. BasedOnObject may contain references to any number of objects which serve as a basis for this object, a BasedOnRationalDescription of how the content of the referenced object was incorporated or altered, and a BasedOnRationalCode to allow for specific typing of the BasedOnReference according to an external controlled vocabulary."
   "RelatedOtherMaterialReference",":doc:`/item-types/OtherMaterial/index`","0..n","The inclusion of an existing OtherMaterial by reference. Use for any type of OtherMaterial not specifically addressed by an inline description for such as ExternalAid in QuestionItem."
   "VersionDate","`cogsDate <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#cogsdate>`_","0..1","Date of version using the union set BaseDateType. Duration should not be used in this field, even though allowed by the ISO format enforced by the parser."
   "IsPublished","`boolean <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#boolean>`_","0..1","Indicates that the maintainable will not be changed without versioning, and is a stable target for referencing."
