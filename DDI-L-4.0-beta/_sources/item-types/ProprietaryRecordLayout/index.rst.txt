ProprietaryRecordLayout
-----------------------

A member of the BaseRecordLayout substitution group intended for use when the data items are stored in an external proprietary format. In addition to the link to the PhysicalStructure provided by BaseRecordLayout, the record layout is this namespace (m4) identifies the character set and array base for the external data, identifies the software of the proprietary system, provides a description of how the data item is addressed within the system, provides default values for numeric data types, text data types, dateTime data types, whether coded data should be treated as numeric or text, a default variable scheme, proprietary information, and a full description of each data item including its link to the variable description and system address.

   "CharacterSet",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","Character set used in the data file (e.g., US ASCII, EBCDIC, UTF-8). This is a required field. The DDI Alliance has provided a controlled vocabulary (CharacterSet) to support this element at http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies."
   "ArrayBase","`int <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#int>`_","0..1","Sets the array base for any arrays used in the definition (that is, whether the first value is in position 0 or 1, etc.). This may be the data array in a delimited data file or the measure array for measures that are bundled and stored in a single location. Array base is generally set to either 0 or 1. There is no override provided as systems processing a record would use a consistent array base."
   "SystemSoftware",":doc:`/composite-types/SoftwareType/index`","0..1","Specification of a software package used to instantiate a data collection method."
   "DataItemAddress",":doc:`/composite-types/DataItemAddressType/index`","0..1","Provides minimum information on data item address system, such as variable ID or Name, etc."
   "DefaultNumericDataTypeReference",":doc:`/item-types/ManagedNumericRepresentation/index`","0..1","Declares the most common data type used for numeric data."
   "DefaultTextDataTypeReference",":doc:`/item-types/ManagedTextRepresentation/index`","0..1","Declares the most common data type used for textual data."

   "CodedDataAsNumeric",":doc:`/item-types/ManagedNumericRepresentation/index`","0..1","Indicates that coded data should be treated as numeric, and defines the numeric type."
   "CodedDataAsText",":doc:`/item-types/ManagedTextRepresentation/index`","0..1","Indicates that coded data should be treated as text, and defines the text type."
   "DefaultVariableSchemeReference",":doc:`/item-types/VariableScheme/index`","0..1","References a variable scheme for the RecordLayout. This can be overridden by individual data items if they are from a different variable scheme."
   "ProprietaryInfo",":doc:`/composite-types/ProprietaryInfoType/index`","0..1","Contains information proprietary to the software package which produced the data file. This is expressed as a set of key(name)/ value pairs."
   "DataItemP",":doc:`/composite-types/DataItemPType/index`","0..n","Describes a single data item within the file including its variable reference, information on the data type, and any item specific proprietary information."

   "PhysicalStructureLinkReference",":doc:`/item-types/PhysicalStructure/index`","0..1","Reference to the PhysicalStructure and the PhysicalSegment used by this Record Layout."
   "EndOfLineMarker",":doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`","0..1","Specifies the end-of-line (EOL) marker used in the file as produced. If no value is provided assume the use of a CRLF (carriage return and line feed). This is the common EOL for PC's. The common EOL in a Unix environment is LF. Some systems will automatically translate EOLs when a file is moved across systems. Common EOLs include: CR (carriage return), LF (line feed), CRLF, NEL (next line), VT (vertical tab), FF (form feed), LS (line separator) and PS (paragraph separator). See Part I documentation for more detailed information. This object supports the use of a controlled vocabulary. Use of a common controlled vocabulary is strongly recommended."
   "TextQualifier","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","0..1","Use for delimited files to designate the which text qualifier, if any, was used. Valid values include: singleQuote, doubleQuote, and none. Valid values include: singleQuote, doubleQuote, none"

This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."

Note that versioning can only take place on objects owned by the specified DDI Agency. If you are creating a local instance of an object from another agency for current or future modification use BasedOnObject. If the changes being made result in what you determine to be new object rather than a version of a previous object, i.e. the change is too extensive to consider it a version of the existing object, create a new object and use BasedOnObject to provide a link to the object or objects that were a basis for the new object."
   "BasedOnObject",":doc:`/composite-types/BasedOnObjectType/index`","0..1","Use when creating an object that is based on an existing object or objects that are managed by a different agency or when the new object is NOT simply a version change but you wish to maintain a reference to the object that served as a basis for the new object. BasedOnObject may contain references to any number of objects which serve as a basis for this object, a BasedOnRationalDescription of how the content of the referenced object was incorporated or altered, and a BasedOnRationalCode to allow for specific typing of the BasedOnReference according to an external controlled vocabulary."
   "RelatedOtherMaterialReference",":doc:`/item-types/OtherMaterial/index`","0..n","The inclusion of an existing OtherMaterial by reference. Use for any type of OtherMaterial not specifically addressed by an inline description for such as ExternalAid in QuestionItem."
