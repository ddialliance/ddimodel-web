--------------------

Defines the area of attachment for an NCube attribute. It may be defined as the NCube as a whole or as certain dimensions or values of dimensions.

   "Label",":doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`","0..n","A display label for the CoordinateRegion. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations."
   "UniverseReference",":doc:`/item-types/Universe/index`","0..n","Reference to the universe statement containing a description of the persons or other elements that this CoordinateRegion refers to, and to which any analytic results refer. If more than one universe is referenced the universe of the CoordinateRegion is the intersect of the referenced universes. Use when the CoordinateRegion describes a subset of the NCube universe."
   "Description",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","A description of the content of the CoordinateRegion. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content."
   "DimensionValue",":doc:`/composite-types/CohortType/index`","0..n","Defines the included set of values needed to describe the coordinate region of the NCube on a Dimension by Dimension basis."

   "URN","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","The URN of the entity matching the DDI URN pattern associated with the value of the attribute typeOfIdentifier (Canonical or Deprecated)."
   "Agency","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","This is the registered agency code with optional sub-agencies separated by dots."
   "ID","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","The ID of the object. This must conform to the allowed structure of the DDI Identifier and must be unique within the declared scope of uniqueness (Agency or Maintainable)."
   "Version","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","The version number of the object. For the identifiable object this is the version number of its parent versionable at the point of creation or alteration of the non-administrative metadata of the identifiable. Versionable and Maintainable items increment their version number whenever the non-administrative metadata contained by the object changes."
   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
