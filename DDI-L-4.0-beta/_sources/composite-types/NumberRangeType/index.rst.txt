NumberRangeType
---------------

Structures a numeric range. Low and High values are designated. The structure identifies Low values that should be treated as bottom coded (Stated value and bellow, High values that should be treated as top coded (stated value and higher), and provides a regular expression to further define the valid content of the range.

   "Label",":doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`","0..n","A display label for the number range. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations."
   "Low",":doc:`/composite-types/NumberRangeValueType/index`","0..1","The lower bound of the range expressed in the data type xs:decimal. If not present, then there is no lower bound."
   "LowDouble",":doc:`/composite-types/DoubleNumberRangeValueType/index`","0..1","The lower bound of the range expressed in the data type xs:double. If not present, then there is no lower bound."
   "High",":doc:`/composite-types/NumberRangeValueType/index`","0..1","The upper bound of the range in the data type xs:decimal. If not present, then there is no upper bound."
