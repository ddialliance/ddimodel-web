   "SourceItemReference",":doc:`/item-types/Versionable/index`","0..1","A reference to the source object in the source scheme already identified. TypeOfObject dependent on object of comparison."
   "TargetItemReference",":doc:`/item-types/Versionable/index`","0..n","A reference the target object or objects in the target scheme already identified. TypeOfObject dependent on object of comparison. Note that if multiple target items are identified the correspondence between the source and ALL target items must be identical."
   "Correspondence",":doc:`/composite-types/CorrespondenceType/index`","0..1","Describe the level of similarity and difference between the Source and the Target objects."
   "RelatedMapReference",":doc:`/composite-types/ItemMapType/index`","0..n","Identifies related maps for example an ItemMap of two questions may point to the CodeMap defining the comparison of the two response domains."
   "Alias","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","0..1","Allows for an alias to be assigned to the correspondence between two items, so that it can be referred to with a single name, that would include both related items."

   "URN","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","The URN of the entity matching the DDI URN pattern associated with the value of the attribute typeOfIdentifier (Canonical or Deprecated)."
   "Agency","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","This is the registered agency code with optional sub-agencies separated by dots."
   "ID","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","The ID of the object. This must conform to the allowed structure of the DDI Identifier and must be unique within the declared scope of uniqueness (Agency or Maintainable)."
   "Version","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","The version number of the object. For the identifiable object this is the version number of its parent versionable at the point of creation or alteration of the non-administrative metadata of the identifiable. Versionable and Maintainable items increment their version number whenever the non-administrative metadata contained by the object changes."
   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
