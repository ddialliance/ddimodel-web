SelectDimensionType
-------------------

For each dimension in the grid define the applicable values as "all values", a "specific value" or a range. If a rangeMinimum or rangeMaximum is provided without the other, the assumption is unbounded for the object not included.

   "Rank","`nonNegativeInteger <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#nonnegativeinteger>`_","1..1","The rank value of the dimension for which the selection criteria apply."
   "AllValues","`boolean <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#boolean>`_","0..1","If set to ""true"" applies to the full set of dimension values. If set to ""false"" use specificValue, rangeMinimum and rangeMaximum as appropriate to define the subset of values needed."
   "SpecificValue","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","0..1","May contain a single value or a delimited array of values."
   "RangeMinimum","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","0..1","The inclusive minimum value of the range. Use when the values or subset of values are ordered and contiguous and may be expressed as a range."
   "RangeMaximum","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","0..1","The inclusive maximum value of the range. Use when the values or subset of values are ordered and contiguous and may be expressed as a range."
