AggregationVariablesType
------------------------

Identifies the independent and dependent variables used in the aggregation process. Note that in the case of calculating a percentage, mean, etc. of a dependent value against the total population of the cell, there is no independent variable.

   "IndependentVariableReference",":doc:`/item-types/Variable/index`","0..n","A reference to a variable, which is an important constraint for the computed aggregation measure and has the potential to invoke a change in a dependent variable like sex for average of income. In the context of calculating percentages, the use of Sex as the independent variable would indicate that the percentages provided represent the percentage of the dependent variable associated with a specific value for Sex (i.e., the dependent variable expressed as a percentage of the total for Males). This would be opposed to the percent for the full population (the percent of the total grid population falling within that particular cell)."
   "DependentVariableReference",":doc:`/item-types/Variable/index`","0..n","A reference to a variable, for which the aggregate measure is computed like average of income."

   "URN","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","The URN of the entity matching the DDI URN pattern associated with the value of the attribute typeOfIdentifier (Canonical or Deprecated)."
   "Agency","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","This is the registered agency code with optional sub-agencies separated by dots."
   "ID","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","The ID of the object. This must conform to the allowed structure of the DDI Identifier and must be unique within the declared scope of uniqueness (Agency or Maintainable)."
   "Version","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","The version number of the object. For the identifiable object this is the version number of its parent versionable at the point of creation or alteration of the non-administrative metadata of the identifiable. Versionable and Maintainable items increment their version number whenever the non-administrative metadata contained by the object changes."
   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
