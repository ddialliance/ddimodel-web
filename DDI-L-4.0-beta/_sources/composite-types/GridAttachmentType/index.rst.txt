   "SpecificCellCoordinate","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","0..1","Defines a single cell by its matrix coordinate address. For example ""1,3,2"" for a 3 dimensional matrix where dimension rank-1 has a value of 1, dimension rank-2 has a value of 3, and dimension rank-3 has a value of 2."
   "CellCoordinatesAsDefined",":doc:`/composite-types/CellCoordinatesAsDefinedType/index`","0..1","Defines one or more cells by defining the applicable values of each dimension as ""all values"", a ""specific value"" or a range. For example in a simple 2 dimensional grid where dimension rank-1 is displayed as rows and dimension rank-2 as columns and the first column contains a NumericDomain; SelectDimension rank=""1"" allValues=""true"" and SelectDimension rank=""2"" specificValue=""1"" would result in the NumericDomain being attached to the first column of the grid only."
   "AllCells","`boolean <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#boolean>`_","0..1","If the item should be attached to all the cells in the grid set this attribute to ""true""."
