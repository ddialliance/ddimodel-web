DateType
--------

Provides the structure of a Date element, which allows a choice between single, simple dates (of BaseDateType) or date ranges. If the Date element contains a range, Cycle may be used to indicate occurrence of this range within a series of ranges as an integer identifying the cycle, i.e. the 4th wave of a data collection cycle would have 4. ISO-formatted dates are required for all standard date fields; a historically-formatted date may also be provided to reflect the specific content of a legacy document or common practice within an agency or for publication. All uses of DateType should be optional.

   "SimpleDate","`cogsDate <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#cogsdate>`_","0..1","A single point in time. If a duration is expressed as a SimpleDate it is defining a period of time without a designated Start or End date."
   "HistoricalDate",":doc:`/composite-types/HistoricalDateType/index`","0..1","A simple date expressed in a historical date format, including a specification of the date format and calendar used."
   "StartDate","`cogsDate <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#cogsdate>`_","0..1","Start of a date range. If there is a start date with no end date provided, this implies that the end date is unknown but that the date being recorded is not just a simple date but a range of unknown duration."
   "HistoricalStartDate",":doc:`/composite-types/HistoricalDateType/index`","0..1","A start date expressed in a historical date format, including a specification of the date format and calendar used."
   "EndDate","`cogsDate <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#cogsdate>`_","0..1","End of a date range with a known start date."
   "HistoricalEndDate",":doc:`/composite-types/HistoricalDateType/index`","0..1","An end date expressed in a historical date format, including a specification of the date format and calendar used."
   "Cycle","`int <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#int>`_","0..1","Use to indicate occurrence of this range within a series of ranges as an integer identifying the cycle, i.e. the 4th wave of a data collection cycle would have 4."
