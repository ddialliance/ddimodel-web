   "Description",":doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`","0..1","Full description of the sampling procedure. Supports structured content and multiple language content."
   "SamplingPlanReference",":doc:`/item-types/SamplingPlan/index`","0..1","Reference to sample plan which describes a process for achieving the sample. TypeOfObject should be SamplingPlan."

   "URN","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","The URN of the entity matching the DDI URN pattern associated with the value of the attribute typeOfIdentifier (Canonical or Deprecated)."
   "Agency","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","This is the registered agency code with optional sub-agencies separated by dots."
   "ID","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","The ID of the object. This must conform to the allowed structure of the DDI Identifier and must be unique within the declared scope of uniqueness (Agency or Maintainable)."
   "Version","`string <https://cogsdata.org/docs/modeler-guide/primitive-types/#string>`_","1..1","The version number of the object. For the identifiable object this is the version number of its parent versionable at the point of creation or alteration of the non-administrative metadata of the identifiable. Versionable and Maintainable items increment their version number whenever the non-administrative metadata contained by the object changes."
   "UserID",":doc:`/composite-types/UserIDType/index`","0..n","Allows for the specification of identifiers other than the specified DDI identification of the object. This may be a legacy ID from DDI-C, a system specific ID such as for a database or registry, or a non-DDI unique identifier. As the identifier is specific to a system the system must be identified with the UserID structure."
   "UserAttributePair",":doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`","0..n","A system specific user defined property of the object expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended."
