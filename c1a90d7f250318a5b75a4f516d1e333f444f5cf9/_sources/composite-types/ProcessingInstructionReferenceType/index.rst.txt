ProcessingInstructionReferenceType
----------------------------------

A reference to a General or Generation Instruction that was used by the parent object, e.g. an instruction used to derive a Variable or used by a ProcessingEvent. The basic Reference structure is extended to allow for the use of Binding to link specific source parameters to the InParameter of the instruction at the point of use. If there is a conflict between a Binding in the iinstruction of a specific source to an InParameter and the Binding information provided in the ProcessingInstructionReference, the Binding information in the reference overrides that found in the instruction. TypeOfObject should be set to ProcessingInstruction.

A structure used to link the content of a parameter declared as the source to a parameter declared as the target. For example, linking the output of a question to the input of a generation instruction. Question A has an OutParameter X. Generation Instruction has an InParameter Y used in the recode instruction. Binding defines the content of InParameter Y to be whatever is provided by OutParameter X for use in the calculation of the recode.
