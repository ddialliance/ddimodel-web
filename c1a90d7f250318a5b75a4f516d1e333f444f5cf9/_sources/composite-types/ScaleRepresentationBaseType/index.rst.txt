ScaleRepresentationBaseType
---------------------------

A means of capturing the structure of Scale for use as a question response domain or variable value representation. In addition to the basic objects of the representation, the structure defines the dimensions of the scale, an intersect for a multi-dimensional scale, and display layout.

Properties

ScaleDimension
**************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/ScaleDimensionType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A description of a dimension of the scale. Note that most scales will have only one dimension.

DimensionIntersect
******************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/DimensionIntersectType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Identifies the point at which the scales of a multidimensional scale intersect.

DisplayLayout
*************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Defines they layout such as containing a drawn scale line, a list of values only, an outline (the boundaries of the area defined by 2 or more intersecting scales such as a diamond of opposites), or some other layout design. Allows for the use of a controlled vocabulary.
