Properties

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A display label for the scale. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

NumberRange
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/NumberRangeType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Indicates the high and low values (endpoints) of a numeric scale.

Range
*****

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/RangeType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Indicates the high and low values (endpoints) of a non-numeric scale.

Anchor
******

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/AnchorType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Allows for the attachment of a category label at any anchor point.

MarkedIncrement
***************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/BasicIncrementType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Identifies the frequency for increment markers (with or without value attachments).

ValueIncrement
**************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/BasicIncrementType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Identifies the frequency for value labels on marked or unmarked increments.

DimensionNumber
***************

Type
    int
Cardinality
    0..1

A number used to identify this dimension when describing its intersect point with one or more dimensions in the same scale representation. The dimension is denoted with a 1-based indexing. Dimension in the scale are numbered (1,2,n).

DegreeSlopeFromHorizontal
*************************

Type
    int
Cardinality
    0..1

A horizontal line is described as a 0 (zero) slope. Expressed as the number of degrees positive (right end angle above the horizontal line) or degrees positive (right end descending below the horizontal line).
