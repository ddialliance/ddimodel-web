CaseIdentificationType
----------------------

Describes the information needed to identify an individual case within a record type. This may be the variable or concatenated variable used to identify a unique case of a particular record type. Often referred to as a unique key. There may be more than one means of identifying a record. For example a US Census Summary File has a LogicalRecordIdentifer that is unique to the original file within which it was published. A specific geography has a set of fields that uniquely identify it.
