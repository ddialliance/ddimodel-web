CodeDomainType
--------------

A response domain capturing a coded response (where both codes and their related category value are displayed) for a question. Includes standard response domain elements; OutParameter, designation of response cardinality, and a declaration of an offset date for the data content. Contains the equivalent content of a CodeRepresentation including a reference to the CodeList used and the ability to limit the use of the CodeList to specific CodeList levels, ranges, or values. Adds a set of elements available to all Response Domains; Label, Description, OutParameter, designation of response cardinality, and a declaration of an offset date for the data content. CodeDomains cannot be included by reference. CodeDomain does not have an equivalent managed representation as the CodeList itself is a managed object. CodeDomains must be entered in-line.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A display label for the domain. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A description of the content and purpose of the domain. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

OutParameter
************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/ParameterType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Allows for the response to be bound to one of the QuestionItem's OutParameters, so the collected information can be used elsewhere, for example as inputs to subsequent questions in an Instrument or to a GenerationInstruction. If multiple responses are possible, this would represent and ordered array of the responses.

ResponseCardinality
*******************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/ResponseCardinalityType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Allows the designation of the minimum and maximum number of responses allowed for this response domain.

ContentDateOffset
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/ContentDateOffsetType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Identifies the difference between the date applied to the data as a whole and this specific item such as previous year's income or residence 5 years ago.
