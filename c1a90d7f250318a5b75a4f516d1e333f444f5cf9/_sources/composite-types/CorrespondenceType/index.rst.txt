CorrespondenceType
------------------

Describes the commonalities and differences between two items using a textual description of both commonalities and differences plus an optional coding of the type of commonality, a commonality expresses as a 0 to 1 weighting factor (expressing degree of comparability) and a user defined correspondence property which is specific to an organization or community of use.

Properties

Commonality
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A description of the common features of the two items using a StructuredString to support multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

Difference
**********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A description of the differences between the two items using a StructuredString to support multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

CommonalityTypeCoded
********************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A brief description describing the commonality of the two schemes/items, i.e., "Identical", "High", "Medium", "Low", "None". Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary.

CommonalityWeight
*****************

Type
    float
Cardinality
    0..1

A value between 0 and 1 expressing the degree of commonality (0 indicates none, 1 indicates that they are identical).

UserDefinedCorrespondenceProperty
*********************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

An alternate means of expressing commonality within a specific system. A system specific user defined correspondence expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended.
