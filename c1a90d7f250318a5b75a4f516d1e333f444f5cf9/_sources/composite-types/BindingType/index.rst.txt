BindingType
-----------

A structure used to bind the content of a parameter declared as the source to a parameter declared as the target. For example, binding the output of a question to the input of a generation instruction. Question A has an OutParameter X. Generation Instruction has an InParameter Y used in the recode instruction. Binding defines the content of InParameter Y to be whatever is provided by OutParameter X for use in the calculation of the recode.
