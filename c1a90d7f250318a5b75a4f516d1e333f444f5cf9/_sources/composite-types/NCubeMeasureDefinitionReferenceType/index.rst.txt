-----------------------------------

This is a reference to a MeasureDefinition as described in the parent NCube logical structure. The reference has an additional attribute orderValue which defines the position of the referenced MeasureDefinition along the MeasureDimension so that it can be used as part of the cell address. The default value is "1". Additional MeasureDefinitions should have incremental values (2,3,4,...).  TypeOfObject should be set to MeasureDefinition.
