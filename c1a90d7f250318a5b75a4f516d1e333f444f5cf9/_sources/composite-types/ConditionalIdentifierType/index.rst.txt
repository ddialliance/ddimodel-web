Case specification allows different unique identifiers to be used based on the value of an identified variable. In some cases the value of a variable (such as a geographic level) results in a different set of variables required to identify a unique case. Case specification is used to capture these combinations. For example: a file containing State, County, and Place records. The unique identifier for a State requires a combination of GeoLevel=State and the variable STATE. Place would require a combination of GeoLevel=Place and the variables STATE and PLACE.
