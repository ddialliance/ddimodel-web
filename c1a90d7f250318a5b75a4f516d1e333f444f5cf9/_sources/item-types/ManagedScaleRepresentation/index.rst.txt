ManagedScaleRepresentation
--------------------------

A means of capturing a managed representation of a Scale for use by a Response Domain Reference or Value Representation Reference. In addition to the name, label, and description of the representation, the structure defines the dimensions of the scale, an intersect for a multi-dimensional scale, and display layout.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

ManagedScaleRepresentationName
******************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A name for the ManagedScaleRepresentation. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A display label for the representation. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A description of the content and purpose of the representation. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

RecommendedDataType
*******************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

This field provides the recommended treatment of the data within an application. The value should come from a controlled vocabulary - recommended values include the set found in W3C XML Schema Part 2, but excluding string sub-types, QNAME, and NOTATION.

GenericOutputFormat
*******************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

This field provides a recommended generic treatment of the data for display by an application. The value should come from a controlled vocabulary.

ScaleDimension
**************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/ScaleDimensionType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A description of a dimension of the scale. Note that most scales will have only one dimension.

DimensionIntersect
******************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/DimensionIntersectType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Identifies the point at which the scales of a multidimensional scale intersect.

DisplayLayout
*************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Defines they layout such as containing a drawn scale line, a list of values only, an outline (the boundaries of the area defined by 2 or more intersecting scales such as a diamond of opposites), or some other layout design. Allows for the use of a controlled vocabulary.

ClassificationLevel
*******************

Type
    string
Cardinality
    0..1

Indicates the type of relationship, nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, or continuous. Use where appropriate for the representation type.
