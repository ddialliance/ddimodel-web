VariableStatistics
------------------

Contains summary and category level statistics for the referenced variable. Includes information on the total number of responses, the weights in calculating the statistics, variable level summary statistics, and category statistics. The category statistics may be provided as unfiltered values or filtered through a single variable. For example the category statistics for Sex filtered by the variable Country for a multi-national data file. Note that if no weighting factor is identified, all of the statistics provided are unweighted.

VariableReference
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Variable/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Reference to the variable to which the statistics apply.

TotalResponses
**************

Type
    int
Cardinality
    0..1

The total number of responses to this variable. This element is especially useful if the number of responses does not match added case counts. It may also be used to sum the frequencies for variable categories.

StandardWeightReference
***********************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StandardWeightType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Reference to the StandardWeight value provided in Weighting.

WeightVariableReference
***********************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Variable/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Reference to a variable to use for weight in calculating the statistic.

MissingValuesReference
**********************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/ManagedMissingValuesRepresentation/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Indicates the missing values that were excluded from the statistic by referencing the ManagedMissingValuesRepresentation used by the Variable.

SummaryStatistic
****************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/SummaryStatisticType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A summary statistic for the referenced variable.

UnfilteredCategoryStatistics
****************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/UnfilteredCategoryStatisticsType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

The unfiltered values of any number of statistics by category value representing the full response distribution of the variable.

FilteredCategoryStatistics
**************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/FilteredCategoryStatisticsType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Includes category-level statistic for the referenced variable using another variable to filter the categories through. For example, the Eurobarometer may filter its category statistics by country as represented in a variable "CountryCode".
