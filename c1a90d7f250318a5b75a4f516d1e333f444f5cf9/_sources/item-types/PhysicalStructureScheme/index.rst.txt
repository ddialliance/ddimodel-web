PhysicalStructureScheme
-----------------------

A scheme containing a set of PhysicalStructures containing descriptions of overall structure of a physical data storage format. These descriptions provide the primary link to the LogicalRecord found in the data file, general structural information such as use of proprietary storage structures, division of logical records into physical segment, and default values for decimal separators, etc. Each description can apply to one or more data files containing the same logical records in the same overall structure. In addition to the standard name, label, and description, it allows for inclusion of an existing PhysicalStructureScheme by reference, and PhysicalStructure or PhysicalStructureGroup descriptions in-line or by reference.

PhysicalStructureSchemeName
***************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A name for the PhysicalStructureScheme. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A display label for the PhysicalStructureScheme. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A description of the PhysicalStructureScheme. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

PhysicalStructureSchemeReference
********************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/PhysicalStructureScheme/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Reference to an existing PhysicalStructureScheme for inclusion.

PhysicalStructureReference
**************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/PhysicalStructure/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A PhysicalStructure description providing the primary link to the LogicalRecord and general structural information. Each description can apply to one or more data files containing the same logical records in the same overall structure.

PhysicalStructureGroupReference
*******************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/PhysicalStructureGroup/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A group of PhysicalStructure descriptions for administrative or conceptual purposes.
