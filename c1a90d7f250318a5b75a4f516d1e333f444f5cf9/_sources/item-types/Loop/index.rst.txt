Loop
----

A member of the control construct substitution group. Describing an action which loops until a limiting condition is met. The ControlConstruct contained in the Loop operates on the LoopVariable until the LoopWhile condition is met, and then control is handed back to the containing control construct.

LoopVariableReference
*********************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/ParameterType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A reference to the variable (as used in the associated CommandCode) which is incremented or otherwise manipulated to meet the conditions stated in the LoopWhile condition.

InitialValue
************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CommandCodeType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Information on the command used to set the initial value for the process. Could be a simple value.

LoopWhile
*********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CommandCodeType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Information on the command used to determine whether the "LoopWhile" condition is met.

StepValue
*********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CommandCodeType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Information on the command used to set the incremental or step value for the process. Could be a simple value.

ControlConstructReference
*************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/ControlConstruct/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A reference to the ControlConstruct to implement until the LoopWhile condition is met. This could be a single ControlConstruct or a set of ControlConstructs within a Sequence.
