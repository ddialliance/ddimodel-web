PhysicalStructureLinkReference
******************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/PhysicalStructure/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Reference to the PhysicalStructure and the PhysicalSegment used by this Record Layout.

EndOfLineMarker
***************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Specifies the end-of-line (EOL) marker used in the file as produced. If no value is provided assume the use of a CRLF (carriage return and line feed). This is the common EOL for PC's. The common EOL in a Unix environment is LF. Some systems will automatically translate EOLs when a file is moved across systems. Common EOLs include: CR (carriage return), LF (line feed), CRLF, NEL (next line), VT (vertical tab), FF (form feed), LS (line separator) and PS (paragraph separator). See Part I documentation for more detailed information. This object supports the use of a controlled vocabulary. Use of a common controlled vocabulary is strongly recommended.

TextQualifier
*************

Type
    string
Cardinality
    0..1

Use for delimited files to designate the which text qualifier, if any, was used. Valid values include: singleQuote, doubleQuote, and none.
