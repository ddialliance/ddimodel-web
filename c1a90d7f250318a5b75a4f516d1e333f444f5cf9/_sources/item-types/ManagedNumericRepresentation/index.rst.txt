ManagedNumericRepresentation
----------------------------

A means of capturing a managed representation of a numbers (item that are analyzed as numbers) which can be referenced by a variable or question and used as a value representation or response domain. In addition to the name, label, and description of the managed numeric representation, the structure defines the number range of valid values, plus information on the format, scale, number of decimals, and intervals between valid responses within the range.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

ManagedNumericRepresentationName
********************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A name for the ManagedNumericRepresentation. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A display label for the representation. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A description of the content and purpose of the representation. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

RecommendedDataType
*******************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

This field provides the recommended treatment of the data within an application. The value should come from a controlled vocabulary - recommended values include the set found in W3C XML Schema Part 2, but excluding string sub-types, QNAME, and NOTATION.

GenericOutputFormat
*******************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

This field provides a recommended generic treatment of the data for display by an application. The value should come from a controlled vocabulary.

NumberRange
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/NumberRangeType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Defines the valid number range or number values for the representation.

NumericTypeCode
***************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Identification of the numeric type such as integer, decimal, etc. supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary.

Format
******

Type
    string
Cardinality
    0..1

A format for number expressed as a string.

Scale
*****

Type
    int
Cardinality
    0..1

The scale of the number expressed as an integer (for example a number expressed in 100's, 5 = 500 would have a scale of 100).

DecimalPositions
****************

Type
    int
Cardinality
    0..1

The number of decimal positions expressed as an integer (precision of the number).

Interval
********

Type
    int
Cardinality
    0..1

The interval between valid responses expressed as an integer.

ClassificationLevel
*******************

Type
    string
Cardinality
    0..1

Indicates the type of relationship, nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, or continuous. Use where appropriate for the representation type.
