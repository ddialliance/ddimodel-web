DataCollection
--------------

A maintainable module containing information on activities related to data collection/capture and the processing required for the creation a data product. This section covers the methodologies, events, data sources, collection instruments and processes which comprise the collection/capture and processing of data. Methodology covers approaches used for selecting samples, administering surveys, timing repeated data collection activities. Collection Event specifies data sources, collection instruments, questions and question flow, and data processing activities. This module houses Processing Instructions (General Instructions and Generation Instructions) which may be referenced by variables or comparison maps.The module is described by a name, label, and description, provides spatial, temporal, and topical coverage information on the activities covered by the module, and references to external material related to objects in the module using OtherMaterial. The content of the module is organized within the following sections; Methodology, Collection Event, QuestionScheme (in-line or by reference), ControlConstructScheme (in-line or by references) containing the flow of a questionnaire or data capture process, InterviewerInstructionScheme (in-line or by reference), InstrumentScheme (in-line or by reference) and ProcessingEventScheme (in-line or by reference).

DataCollectionModuleName
************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A name for the DataCollection module. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A display label for the DataCollection module. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A description of the content and purpose of the DataCollection module. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

Coverage
********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CoverageType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Documents the spatial, temporal, and/or topical coverage of the data collection module.

OtherMaterial
*************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/OtherMaterialType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Contains references to other materials relevant to the data collection module, whether in DDI form or external. Links can be made from items in this section to any identifiable element in the instance. Best practice is to include OtherMaterial inside the maintainable containing the objects that are related to the OtherMaterial.
