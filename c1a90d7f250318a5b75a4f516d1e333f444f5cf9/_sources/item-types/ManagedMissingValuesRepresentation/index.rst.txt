ManagedMissingValuesRepresentation
----------------------------------

Means of describing the Missing Values within a managed representation so that they can be reused by multiple variables and questions. Variable has a separate Missing Values location for this representation. Questions must use a StructuredMixedResponseDomain to include both standard response and Missing Value responses in a single question. In addition to the name, label, and description of the representation, the structure defines the type of the missing values, a optional generation instruction for deriving the value to be recorded, and the ability to define a blank as a missing value.

ManagedMissingValuesRepresentationName
**************************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A name for the missing value. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A display label for the managed representation. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A description of the content and purpose of the managed representation. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

MissingCodeRepresentation
*************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CodeRepresentationBaseType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

In-line description of a CodeRepresentationBase created for the purpose of capturing missing values with associated labels.

MissingNumericRepresentation
****************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/NumericRepresentationBaseType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

In-line description of a NumericRepresentationBase created for the purpose of capturing missing values as a set of numbers or a range.

MissingTextRepresentation
*************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/TextRepresentationBaseType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

In-line description of a TextRepresentationBase created for the purpose of capturing missing values as text content.

ProcessingInstructionReference_GenerationInstruction
****************************************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/GenerationInstruction/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

An optional reference to a GenerationInstruction describing how to generate the value for this representation when used as a response domain or missing value representation.

ProcessingInstructionReference_GeneralInstruction
*************************************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/GeneralInstruction/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

An optional reference to a GenerationInstruction describing how to generate the value for this representation when used as a response domain or missing value representation.

IsBlankMissingValue
*******************

Type
    boolean
Cardinality
    0..1

Designates no response (white space, null) to be treated as a missing value.
