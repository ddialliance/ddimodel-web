StudyUnit
---------

A primary packaging and publication module within DDI representing the purpose, background, development, data capture, and data products related to a study. In DDI a study is defined as a single coordinated set of data collection/capture activities, such as a one-time survey or a single iteration of a multi-year repeated study (such as one year of a longitudinal survey). The StudyUnit brings together all of the components of the study including the description of its purpose, funding, quality statements, data collection and capture methods and activities, processing activities, and a description of the resulting data (description of its intellectual or logical content plus a description of its physical store). A study unit may have only a single data collection or capture process resulting in one or more data products (i.e., Census). A complex study unit may contain multiple means of data capture that are integrated into one or more data products (i.e., a medical study collecting bio-markers, patient background, health care service information, etc.). A longitudinal study with multiple waves or iterations of data collection is considered to be a group of studies, each wave or iteration captured as a single study unit. As a primary packaging module, the Study Unit contains a full citation, abstract, authorization information, a universe reference, series statement, quality statement, information on post study evaluation, funding information, budget, purpose, coverage, type of analysis units covered, kind of data, other materials, a list of required resource packages, embargoes,  the conceptual components (universe, concept, data element, geographic structure and locations), data collection, logical products, physical data products, physical instance, archive, and DDI profile. The maintainable elements within a Study Unit may be included in-line or by reference.

    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

An abstract of the study unit describing the nature and scope of the data collection, special characteristics of its content. Note that detailed information on the purpose of the study and structured coverage information are to be entered in Purpose and Coverage. Abstract supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

AuthorizationSource
*******************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/AuthorizationSourceType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Identifies the authorizing agency for the study and allows for the full text of the authorization (law, regulation, or other form of authorization). May be used to list authorizations from oversight committees and other regulatory agencies.

UniverseReference
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Universe/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Reference to the universe statement from the universe scheme, describing the group of persons or other elements that are the object of research and to which any analytic results refer. Age, nationality, and residence commonly help to delineate a given universe, but any of a number of factors may be involved, such as sex, race, income, veteran status, criminal convictions, etc. The universe may consist of elements other than persons, such as housing units, court cases, deaths, countries, etc. In general, it should be possible to tell from the description of the universe whether a given individual or element (hypothetical or real) is a member of the population under study. A universe may be described as "inclusive" or "exclusive". This StudyUnit level reference is normally to the top level of the UniverseScheme.

SeriesStatement
***************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/SeriesStatementType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A study, particularly one in a series, may be the result of two series merging into a single study. The new study belongs to both series. For example, Niger now fields the UNICEF Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS) and the Demographic and Health Survey as a single merged instrument.

QualityStatementSchemeReference
*******************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/QualityStatementScheme/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A scheme containing statements of quality related to the quality of methodologies, metadata, or data. Quality statements may be related to external quality standards.

ExPostEvaluation
****************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/ExPostEvaluationType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

An evaluation of the study process, often taking place after the completion of the study. These may include issues such as timing of the study, sequencing issues, cost/budget issues, relevance, institutional or legal arrangements etc. of the study. If the study is part of a series or group (i.e., a single wave in a longitudinal study) this may include evaluation of earlier waves which resulted in changes to the current wave.
