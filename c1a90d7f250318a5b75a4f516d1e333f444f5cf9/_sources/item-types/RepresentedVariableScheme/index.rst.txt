RepresentedVariableScheme
-------------------------

A set of RepresentedVariables managed by an agency. RepresentedVariables are the core reusable parts of a Variable. RepresentedVariable maps to the GSIM Represented Variable. In addition to the standard name, label, and description, allows for the inclusion of an existing RepresentedVariableScheme by reference and RepresentedVariables either in-line or by reference. RepresentedVariables may be grouped for management purposes.

RepresentedVariableSchemeName
*****************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A name for the RepresentedVariableScheme. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A display label for the RepresentedVariableScheme. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A description of the RepresentedVariableScheme. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

RepresentedVariableSchemeReference
**********************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/RepresentedVariableScheme/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Inclusion of an existing RepresentedVariableScheme by reference. TypeOfObject should be set to RepresentedVariableScheme

RepresentedVariableReference
****************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/RepresentedVariable/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Describes a RepresentedVariable contained in the RepresentedVariableScheme. A RepresentedVariable contains a reference to the Concept and Universe (or ConceptualVariable) as well as the representation of the RepresentedVariable. Representation may be provided in-line or by reference to a managed representation. RepresentedVariables are the core reusable parts of a Variable. RepresentedVariable maps to the GSIM Represented Variable.

RepresentedVariableGroupReference
*********************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/RepresentedVariableGroup/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

In-line description of a group of RepresentedVariables. RepresentedVariables may be grouped for a wide range of reasons including conceptual or universe grouping, usage, subject or keyword relationships, or other grouping reason that will assist in the management of a group of RepresentedVariables.
