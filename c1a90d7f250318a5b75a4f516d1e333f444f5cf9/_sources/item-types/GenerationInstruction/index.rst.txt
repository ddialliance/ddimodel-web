---------------------

Processing instructions for recodes, derivations from multiple question or variable sources, and derivations based on external sources. Instructions should be listed separately so they can be referenced individually.

SourceQuestion
**************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/QuestionItem/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Reference to a question used in the instruction.

SourceVariable
**************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Variable/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Reference to a variable used in the coding process

ExternalInformation
*******************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/OtherMaterialType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Reference to an external source of information used in the coding process, for example a value from a chart, etc.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A description of the generation instruction. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

CommandCode
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CommandCodeType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Structured information used by a system to process the instruction.

ControlConstructReference
*************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/ControlConstruct/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A control construct which is used to describe or process the instruction.

Aggregation
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/AggregationType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Describes the aggregation process, identifying both the independent and dependent variables within the process.

IsDerived
*********

Type
    boolean
Cardinality
    0..1

Default setting is "true", the instruction describes a derivation. If the instruction is a simple recode, set to "false".
