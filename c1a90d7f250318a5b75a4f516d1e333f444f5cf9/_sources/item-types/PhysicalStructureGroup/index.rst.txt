PhysicalStructureGroup
----------------------

A group of PhysicalStructure descriptions for administrative or conceptual purposes. May be hierarchical. In addition to the standard name, label, and description, allows for a brief classification of the group type, reference to an applicable Universe and Concept, inclusion of PhysicalStructures and PhysicalStructureGroups by reference and an indicator which can be set to "true" if the group is ordered.

TypeOfPhysicalStructureGroup
****************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A generic element for specifying a reason for a PhysicalStructureGroup. Note that this element can contain either a term from a controlled vocabulary list or a textual description.

PhysicalStructureGroupName
**************************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A name for the PhysicalStructureGroup. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A display label for the PhysicalStructureGroup. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A description of the PhysicalStructureGroup. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

UniverseReference
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Universe/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Reference to the universe statement describing the persons or other objects to which the contents of this group pertain.

ConceptReference
****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Concept/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Reference to the concept expressed by the objects in this group.

Subject
*******

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/InternationalCodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

If subjects are listed for this group, it is strongly recommended that the subjects listed also be found in the TopicalCoverage element for the parent packaging element when this group is included directly or by reference in a module containing a coverage element. Use of subject at the group level allows for associating objects as a type of subject based group or to identify subject characteristics of a reusable group of objects.

Keyword
*******

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/InternationalCodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

If keywords are listed for this group, it is strongly recommended that the keywords listed also be found in the TopicalCoverage element for the parent packaging element when this group is included directly or by reference in a module containing a coverage element. Use of keyword at the group level allows for associating objects as a type of keyword based group or to identify keyword characteristics of a reusable group of objects.

PhysicalStructureReference
**************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/PhysicalStructure/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Reference to constituent PhysicalStructure.

PhysicalStructureGroupReference
*******************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/PhysicalStructureGroup/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Reference to constituent PhysicalStructureGroup. This allows for nesting of PhysicalStructureGroups.

IsOrdered
*********

Type
    boolean
Cardinality
    0..1

If set to "true" indicates that the content of the group is ordered as it appears within the XML structure.
