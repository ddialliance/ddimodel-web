GenericMap
----------

Maps the content of two different schemes of objects of the same type providing detail for the comparable items within those two schemes. Note that comparisons can be made between multiple items in the same scheme or two versions of the same scheme. In addition to the standard name, label, and description of the map, identifies the source scheme and target scheme containing those objects, describes the correspondence between the source and target schemes, and provides detailed comparison of the items within those two schemes.

Properties

MapName
*******

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A name for the Map. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

A display label for the Map. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

A description of the content and purpose of the Map. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

SourceSchemeReference
*********************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/SchemeReferenceType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Mappings are unidirectional. The scheme referenced as the source is the scheme contents that would be transformed into the scheme contents identified as the target scheme contents.

TargetSchemeReference
*********************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/SchemeReferenceType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Reference to the scheme containing the target structure.

Correspondence
**************

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/CorrespondenceType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

Describe the level of similarity and difference between the Source and the Target schemes.

ItemMap
*******

Type
    :doc:`/reusable-types/ItemMapType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

Contains the mappings for individual items within the Source and Target schemes.
