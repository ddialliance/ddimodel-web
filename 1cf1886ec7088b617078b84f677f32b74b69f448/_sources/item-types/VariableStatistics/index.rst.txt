VariableStatistics
------------------

Contains summary and category level statistics for the referenced variable. Includes information on the total number of responses, the weights in calculating the statistics, variable level summary statistics, and category statistics. The category statistics may be provided as unfiltered values or filtered through a single variable. For example the category statistics for Sex filtered by the variable Country for a multi-national data file. Note that if no weighting factor is identified, all of the statistics provided are unweighted.

VariableReference
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Variable/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the variable to which the statistics apply.

TotalResponses
**************

Type
    nonNegativeInteger
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicalinstance:3_3

The total number of responses to this variable. This element is especially useful if the number of responses does not match added case counts. It may also be used to sum the frequencies for variable categories.

StandardWeightReference
***********************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StandardWeightType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicalinstance:3_3

Reference to the StandardWeight value provided in Weighting.

WeightVariableReference
***********************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Variable/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to a variable to use for weight in calculating the statistic.

MissingValuesReference
**********************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/ManagedMissingValuesRepresentation/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicalinstance:3_3

Indicates the missing values that were excluded from the statistic by referencing the ManagedMissingValuesRepresentation used by the Variable.

SummaryStatistic
****************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/SummaryStatisticType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicalinstance:3_3

A summary statistic for the referenced variable.

UnfilteredCategoryStatistics
****************************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/UnfilteredCategoryStatisticsType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicalinstance:3_3

The unfiltered values of any number of statistics by category value representing the full response distribution of the variable.

FilteredCategoryStatistics
**************************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/FilteredCategoryStatisticsType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:physicalinstance:3_3

Includes category-level statistic for the referenced variable using another variable to filter the categories through. For example, the Eurobarometer may filter its category statistics by country as represented in a variable "CountryCode".
