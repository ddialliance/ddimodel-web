PolygonType
-----------

A closed plane figure bounded by three or more line segments, representing a geographic area. Contains either the URI of the file containing the polygon, a specific link code for the shape within the file, and a file format, or a minimum of 4 points to describe the polygon in-line. Note that the first and last point must be identical in order to close the polygon. A triangle has 4 points. A geographic time designating the time period that the shape is valid should be included. If the date range is unknown use a SingleDate indicating a date that the shape was known to be valid.

ExternalURI
***********

Type
    anyURI
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Note that ExternalURI points to the boundary file location.

PolygonLinkCode
***************

Type
    string
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

The PolygonLinkCode is the identifier of the specific polygon within the file. For example in an NHGIS file the LinkCodeForPolygon for Tract 101.01 in Hennepin County in Minnesota is 2700530010101.

ShapeFileFormat
***************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

The format of the shape file existing at the location indicated by the sibling ExternalURI element.

Point
*****

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/PointType/index`
Cardinality
    4..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A geographic point defined by a latitude and longitude. A minimum of 4 points is required as the first and last point should be identical in order to close the polygon. Note that a triangle has three sides and requires 3 unique points plus a fourth point replicating the first point in order to close the polygon.
