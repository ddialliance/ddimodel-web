MeasurementGroup
----------------

Contains a group of MeasurementItem, which may be ordered or hierarchical. In addition to the name, label, and description of the group, the structure allows for defining the type of group using an optional controlled vocabulary, a reference to a defining universe or concept for the group, a subject classification for the group, and a listing of MeasurementItems and MeasurementGroups in any order.

Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

A brief textual identification of the group type. Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary.

MeasurementGroupName
********************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/NameType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

A name for the group. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.

Label

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A display label for the question group. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A description of the content and purpose of the MeasurementItemGroup. May be expressed in multiple languages and supports the use of structured content.

UniverseReference
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Universe/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the universe statement describing the persons or other objects to which the contents of this MeasurementItem group pertain.

ConceptReference
****************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/Concept/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to the concept expressed by the MeasurementItem in this group.

Subject
*******

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/InternationalCodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

If subjects are listed for this group, it is strongly recommended that the subjects listed also be found in the TopicalCoverage element for the parent packaging element when this group is included directly or by reference in a module containing a coverage element. Use of subject at the group level allows for associating objects as a type of subject based group or to identify subject characteristics of a reusable group of objects.

Keyword
*******

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/InternationalCodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

If keywords are listed for this group, it is strongly recommended that the keywords listed also be found in the TopicalCoverage element for the parent packaging element when this group is included directly or by reference in a module containing a coverage element. Use of keyword at the group level allows for associating objects as a type of keyword based group or to identify keyword characteristics of a reusable group of objects.

MeasurementItemReference
************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/MeasurementItem/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Reference to constituent MeasurementItem.

MeasurementGroupReference
*************************

Type
    :doc:`/item-types/MeasurementGroup/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace

*********

Type
    boolean
Cardinality
    0..1

If set to "true" indicates that the content of the group is ordered as it appears within the XML structure.
