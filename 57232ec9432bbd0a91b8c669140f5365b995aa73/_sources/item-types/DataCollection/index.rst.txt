DataCollection
--------------

A maintainable module containing information on activities related to data collection/capture and the processing required for the creation a data product. This section covers the methodologies, events, data sources, collection instruments and processes which comprise the collection/capture and processing of data. Methodology covers approaches used for selecting samples, administering surveys, timing repeated data collection activities. Collection Event specifies data sources, collection instruments, questions and question flow, and data processing activities. This module houses Processing Instructions (General Instructions and Generation Instructions) which may be referenced by variables or comparison maps.The module is described by a name, label, and description, provides spatial, temporal, and topical coverage information on the activities covered by the module, and references to external material related to objects in the module using OtherMaterial. The content of the module is organized within the following sections; Methodology, DataCaptureDevelopment, Collection Event, QuestionScheme (in-line or by reference), ControlConstructScheme (in-line or by references) containing the flow of a questionnaire or data capture process, InterviewerInstructionScheme (in-line or by reference), InstrumentScheme (in-line or by reference), ProcessingEventScheme (in-line or by reference), SamplingScheme (in-line or by reference) and DevelopmentActivityScheme.

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:datacollection:3_3

Data capture development covers the development planning, process, and outcome for a partial or full data capture object (question, measurement, instrument, or control construct). Development normally included the development of the question wording, possible response domains and their presentation, translation for language or cultural variance in the population, question/measurement order and mode of delivery (instrument). Extensive work is often done for individual questions/measures that may be reused by different data capture instruments with the organization or for topical areas or populations that are difficult to measure.
