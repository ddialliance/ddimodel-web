CodeDomainType
--------------

A response domain capturing a coded response (where both codes and their related category value are displayed) for a question. Includes standard response domain elements; OutParameter, designation of response cardinality, and a declaration of an offset date for the data content. Contains the equivalent content of a CodeRepresentation including a reference to the CodeList used and the ability to limit the use of the CodeList to specific CodeList levels, ranges, or values. Adds a set of elements available to all Response Domains; Label, Description, OutParameter, designation of response cardinality, and a declaration of an offset date for the data content. CodeDomains cannot be included by reference. CodeDomain does not have an equivalent managed representation as the CodeList itself is a managed object. CodeDomains must be entered in-line.

Label
*****

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/LabelType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A display label for the domain. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.

Description
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

A description of the content and purpose of the domain. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

OutParameter
************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/ParameterType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Allows for the response to be bound to one of the QuestionItem's OutParameters, so the collected information can be used elsewhere, for example as inputs to subsequent questions in an Instrument or to a GenerationInstruction. If multiple responses are possible, this would represent and ordered array of the responses.

ResponseCardinality
*******************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/ResponseCardinalityType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Allows the designation of the minimum and maximum number of responses allowed for this response domain.

ContentDateOffset
*****************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/ContentDateOffsetType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Identifies the difference between the date applied to the data as a whole and this specific item such as previous year's income or residence 5 years ago.

DisplayCode
***********

Type
    boolean
Cardinality
    0..1

If set to "true" (default value) the code value associated with the category label will be displayed. Set to "false" if only the category label should not be displayed.
