GrossRecordStructureType
------------------------

The gross or macro level structures of the record structure including the link to the LogicalRecord and information on the number and ordering of each Physical Segment of the LogicalRecord as stored in the data file. Provides an attribute stating the number of physical segments with a default value of "1".

A description of each physical storage segment required to completely cover the logical record. A logical record may be stored in one or more segments housed hierarchically in a single file or in separate data files. All logical records have at least one segment.

Number of physical records segments each logical record (case) is divided into. Express as an integer. Caution in using checksums is recommended. Conflict between checksums and the items being counted can cause problems with warning flags during processing. If using checksum to capture information for internal processing purposes, the use of automatically generated check sums is strongly urged.
