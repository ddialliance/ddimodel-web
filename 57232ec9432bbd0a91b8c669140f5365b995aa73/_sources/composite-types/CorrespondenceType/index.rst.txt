CorrespondenceType
------------------

Describes the commonalities and differences between two items using a textual description of both commonalities and differences plus an optional coding of the type of commonality, a commonality expresses as a 0 to 1 weighting factor (expressing degree of comparability) and a user defined correspondence property which is specific to an organization or community of use.

Commonality
***********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:comparative:3_3

Common features of the compared objects.  Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

Difference
**********

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StructuredStringType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

Description of the difference between the compared objects.  Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.

CommonalityTypeCoded
********************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/CodeValueType/index`
Cardinality
    0..1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:comparative:3_3

A brief description describing the commonality of the two schemes/items, i.e., "Identical", "High", "Medium", "Low", "None". Supports the use of an external controlled vocabulary. The DDI Alliance has provided a controlled vocabulary (CommonalityType) to support this element at http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies.

CommonalityWeight
*****************

Type
    float
Cardinality
    0..1

Minimum Value (Inclusive)
    0

Maximum Value (Inclusive)
    1

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:comparative:3_3

A value between 0 and 1 expressing the degree of commonality (0 indicates none, 1 indicates that they are identical).

UserDefinedCorrespondenceProperty
*********************************

Type
    :doc:`/composite-types/StandardKeyValuePairType/index`
Cardinality
    0..n

DDI namespace
    Element in ddi:reusable:3_3

An alternate means of expressing commonality within a specific system. A system specific user defined correspondence expressed as a key/value pair. As this is specific to an individual system the use of controlled vocabularies for the key is strongly recommended.
